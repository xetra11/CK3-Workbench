Go to the character creation menu either by
* Pressing Ctrl-C
* Menu bar "Characters > Create Character"
* Left side toolbar crown icon with the green "plus" symbol

Then edit the characters name and basic attributes. Select the traits and skills the character should have and if you are finished
press the "Create" button. The character should now appear in the character list (crown icon on the left toolbar). You can export that
character list either by
* Pressing Ctrl-E
* Menu bar "Characters > Export Characters"

The exported characters will appear in a file called `characters.txt` in the directory of the Workbench tool.
